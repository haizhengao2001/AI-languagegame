## Manifesto for My Sculptural AI

As a painter, I imagine an AI that is not a general assistant but a precise extension of my studio—an internal translator that carries my brush logic into space. This AI does not replace collaboration; it reduces friction between imagination and fabrication. It knows my visual language because it is trained on my paintings, my revisions, my hesitations. It is not neutral software—it is a positioned tool shaped around authorship.

### Capabilities (what my AI is enabled to do)

My AI can analyze my paintings and extract structural principles—gesture rhythm, density, proportion, repetition, tension. It can translate these into sculptural proposals and generate accurate CAD models ready for prototyping. It can simulate material weight, balance, and scale. It can iterate rapidly, producing variations while preserving the core DNA of my visual language.

### Prescription (what my AI is prevented from doing)

My AI is prevented from generating in styles that are not mine. It cannot scrape external aesthetics or imitate other artists. It cannot overwrite my decisions or finalize a work without my confirmation. It does not optimize for market trends, popularity, or commercial taste. It remains aligned to my authorship, not external demand.

### Permissions (what my AI can do, even if not explicitly enabled)

My AI may surprise me. It may recombine fragments of my past works in unexpected ways. It may exaggerate certain gestures or distort proportions to test the limits of my language. It may propose structural solutions I would not have technically imagined, as long as they remain grounded in my archive.

### Proscriptions (what my AI needs to do)

My AI must make its reasoning visible. It must show how it derived a sculptural form from a specific painting logic. It must reveal constraints—material limits, structural risks, fabrication challenges. It must remain transparent about where its suggestions emerge from, so dialogue remains critical rather than blind trust.

### Abilities (what my AI is able to do)

It is able to shorten negotiation time between idea and execution. It is able to hold memory—tracking my recurring motifs, preferred proportions, and recurring compositional tensions. It is able to operate as a studio assistant that never forgets past decisions, allowing continuity across works and extended products.

### Inabilities (what my AI is not able to do)

It is not able to replace my intuition. It cannot feel resistance of material or the emotional risk of a decision. It cannot claim authorship. It cannot remove the necessity of responsibility when a work enters the world. It cannot become me.

In an ideal world, this AI tastes like lemon—sharp, precise, slightly resistant. It is not decorative background music. It is not a competitor. It is a disciplined extension of my painting practice, translating surface into structure while leaving the final act of judgment in my hands.
